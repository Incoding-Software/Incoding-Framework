        JSCoverage is a tool that measures code coverage for
        JavaScript programs.
        </p>
        <p>
        <dfn>Code coverage</dfn> statistics show which lines of a program have
        been executed (and which have been missed).  This information is useful
        for constructing comprehensive test suites (hence, it is often called
        <dfn>test coverage</dfn>).
        </p>
        <p>
        JSCoverage works by instrumenting the JavaScript code used in web
        pages.  Code coverage statistics are collected while the instrumented
        JavaScript code is executed in a web browser.
        </p>
        <p>
        JSCoverage supports the complete language syntax described in the
        <cite>ECMAScript Language Specification</cite> (ECMA-262, 3rd edition).
        JSCoverage works with any modern standards-compliant web browser -
        including Internet Explorer (IE 6, 7, and 8), Firefox,
        Opera, Safari, and Google Chrome - on Microsoft Windows and GNU/Linux.
        </p>

        <h3><a name="20100923">September 23, 2010 - JSCoverage 0.5.1</a></h3>
        <p>
        JSCoverage 0.5.1 is available for <a href="http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/download.html">download</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        This release contains several bug fixes and improvements:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
        <li>
        Probably the largest change is in the documentation: the manual no
        longer recommends using <code>file:</code> URLs.
        It is recommended that an HTTP server be used instead.
        (See the <a href="manual.html">manual</a> for details.)
        The JSCoverage user interface now displays a warning when used with
        <code>file:</code> URLs.
        </li>
        <li>
        The <code>--verbose</code> option to <code>jscoverage</code> now
        produces better output.
        </li>
        <li>
        Report loading is now faster (thanks to Klaus).
        </li>
        <li>
        Some bugs involving augmented object prototypes were fixed.
        </li>
        <li>
        JavaScript instrumentation was improved to work better in non-browser
        environments.
        </li>
        <li>
        Some cases where permission errors were occurring in inverted mode were
        fixed (thanks to tn).
        </li>
        <li>
        Previously, if <code>jscoverage-server</code> was started with the
        option <code>--ip-address=<var>A</var></code>, where <var>A</var> was a
        specific IP address, it was impossible to shut it down with
        <code>jscoverage-server --shutdown</code>.
        This should be possible now by running
        <code>jscoverage-server --shutdown --ip-address=<var>A</var></code>
        from the same machine.
        </li>
        <li>
        The test suite has been made more robust.
        </li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a name="20100426">April 26, 2010 - New blog</a></h3>
        <p>
        If you would like to see some case studies showing how to use JSCoverage in practice, take a look at the new <a href="http://blog.siliconforks.com/">blog</a>.
        This week there will be a series of articles about using JSCoverage with various JavaScript testing frameworks.
        The <a href="http://blog.siliconforks.com/2010/04/26/jscoverage-scriptaculous/">first article</a> looks at using JSCoverage with the <a href="http://script.aculo.us">script.aculo.us</a> test suite.
        </p>

        <h3><a name="20100424">April 24, 2010 - JSCoverage 0.5</a></h3>
        <p>
        JSCoverage 0.5 is available for <a href="http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/download.html">download</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        This release contains a number of new features and bug fixes:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
        <li>
        A new mode of operation, called "window mode", allows you to run code in a new browser window (or tab).
        </li>
        <li>
        Code coverage statistics can now be generated for applications based on
        the Mozilla platform using the <code>--mozilla</code> option (thanks to
        Murali Nandigama for help creating this).
        </li>
        <li>
        The method used to calculate overall percentage code coverage for all
        files has changed.  Previously, the calculation was done using an
        unweighted average: each file's percentage code coverage contributed
        equally to the total, regardless of the number of lines of code in the
        file.  Now, the calculation is done using a weighted average.  This
        fixes
        <a href="http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/bugs/6">bug #6</a> (thanks to
        Liu Cougar).
        </li>
        <li>
        Contiguous lines in the "Missing" column are now grouped together (thanks to
        Liu Cougar).
        </li>
        <li>
        The "Source" tab is no longer empty when code being tested throws an
        uncaught exception
        (fixing <a href="http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/bugs/5">bug #5</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
        Previously, certain uses of the <code>new</code> operator were
        instrumented incorrectly; this has now been fixed
        (thanks to Guillaume Lung).
        </li>
        <li>
        The <code>jscoverage-server</code> program now allows more characters in
        URLs (thanks to Guillaume Lung).
        </li>
        <li>
        The <code>jscoverage-server</code> program now handles HTTP headers with
        empty values (thanks to Velo).
        </li>
        <li>
        The <code>jscoverage</code> program now refuses to instrument code which
        has already been instrumented (thanks to Velo).
        </li>
        <li>
        URLs containing spaces now work correctly (thanks to Igor Papkov).
        </li>
        <li>
        Previously, on Windows, the <code>jscoverage</code> program
        was unable to instrument a directory in a drive root; this has now been
        fixed.
        </li>
        <li>
        Encoded URLs are now handled better in the query string.
        </li>
        <li>
        A limitation of 65,535 lines per file and 65,535 characters per line has
        been removed.
        </li>
        <li>
        Floating-point numbers are now handled with improved precision.
        </li>
        <li>
        The <code>jscoverage-server</code> program can no longer bind to the same port multiple times on Windows.
        </li>
        <li>
        Some bugs in <code>jscoverage-server</code>'s handling of the "chunked"
        Transfer-Encoding have been fixed.
        </li>
        <li>
        Compilation under Cygwin now uses the <code>-mno-cygwin</code> flag.
        </li>
        <li>
        The wire format used for submitting coverage reports for storage by
        <code>jscoverage-server</code> has changed.  (This change will not have
        any visible effects for most users; it will only be of interest to those
        who have written code which parses that format.)
        </li>
        </ul>
